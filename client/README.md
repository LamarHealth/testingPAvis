### Build

Buliding the app as an extension requires an extra step.

First, change your `.env` file to include the proper configuration.

```
# Options: ["local", "build", "liberty"]
REACT_APP_LOCAL=liberty
# If enabled, the application will only fill in forms with a specific data- tag.
# Options: [true, false]
REACT_APP_FILTER=false
```

Run: `yarn build:extension`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
